# CLAUDE.md — qmk_firmware (PolyKybd)

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this QMK fork. The PolyKybd-specific firmware lives at `keyboards/handwired/polykybd/`.

For cross-repo context (how this repo relates to `PolyKybdHost/` and `AdafruitGFX/`), see [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md).

## Firmware overview (`keyboards/handwired/polykybd/`)

The firmware runs on a **Raspberry Pi RP2040** (133 MHz dual-core ARM M0+) and is a heavily customised QMK build. The keyboard is split (left + right halves connected via UART) with up to 72 per-keycap OLED displays (72×40 px monochrome, SPI-driven) plus a 128×64 status OLED.

The host software (`PolyKybdHost/`) communicates with this firmware over a custom HID report protocol (64-byte reports, v0.7.0+).

### Key source files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `hid_com.c` | `raw_hid_receive()` — main HID command dispatcher (21 command IDs, `0x01`–`0x15`) |
| `fill_overlay.c` | Receives overlay segments from host, decompresses RLE, writes to overlay memory |
| `base/overlay.c` | Overlay memory: `overlays[810][360]` — 90 keycap slots × 9 modifier variants × 360 bytes |
| `base/disp_array.c` | Per-keycap OLED driver: `kdisp_write_gfx_char()`, `kdisp_draw_bitmap()`, `kdisp_invert()` |
| `base/shift_reg.c` | Shift-register multiplexing — selects which keycap OLED receives the next SPI write |
| `split_sync.c` | CRC32-validated transactions that synchronise overlays and state to the other half |
| `state.c` | `poly_sync_t` / `poly_layer_t` — shared state structs with CRC32, persisted via EEPROM |
| `multicore_exec.c` | Offloads RLE decompression to RP2040 core1 via FIFO, keeping QMK's core0 responsive |
| `lang/lang_lut.c` | 25-language lookup table (code-generated from `lang_lut.xlsx` via cog) |

### HID protocol (host → firmware)
- 64-byte raw HID reports; byte 0 = Report ID, byte 1 = Command ID, byte 2+ = payload
- All responses are prefixed `"P\xNN."` (ACK) or `"P\xNN!"` (NACK)
- Overlay transmission: each keycap overlay (360 bytes) is split into 6 × 60-byte segments (cmd `0x0A`), or sent RLE-compressed in 1–2 packets (cmds `0x10`/`0x11`)
- ROI updates (cmds `0x12`/`0x13`) allow partial refresh of a keycap's display area
- Overlay index = `keycode_slot + 90 * modifier_variant` (9 variants: bare, Ctrl, Shift, Ctrl+Shift, Alt, Ctrl+Alt, Alt+Shift, Ctrl+Alt+Shift, GUI)

### Display rendering pipeline
1. Host sends compressed bitmap → `fill_overlay.c` decompresses (optionally on core1) → `overlays[idx][360]`
2. On key event, `split72.c` selects the keycap via shift-register bitmask and calls `kdisp_invert()` for instant visual feedback
3. Active window change → host sends new overlay set → firmware swaps all 72 keycap images

### Split synchronisation
Seven custom QMK transaction IDs (`USER_SYNC_POLY_DATA`, `USER_SYNC_OVERLAY_DATA`, `USER_SYNC_COMPRESSED_DATA`, `USER_SYNC_ROI_DATA`, etc.) carry state and overlay data to the slave half over UART with CRC32 validation and up to 10 retries.

### Notable QMK features enabled
RGB matrix (72 LEDs, 35 effects), dynamic keymap (9 layers, VIA-compatible), unicode input (Linux/macOS/Windows/BSD), Cirque trackpad (split72 variant), `USE_CORE1` multicore.

## Font generation

Fonts for the per-keycap OLEDs are generated using the `fontconvert` tool from the [`AdafruitGFX/`](../AdafruitGFX/CLAUDE.md) repo.

- Fonts must be downloaded first: run `keyboards/handwired/polykybd/fonts/dl-fonts.sh` (or download Noto fonts manually)
- `keyboards/handwired/polykybd/create_fonts.sh` calls `fontconvert` for each character range and writes `.h` files to `base/fonts/generated/`
- `base/fonts/gfx_used_fonts.h` is auto-generated: includes all `.h` files and builds `ALL_FONTS[]` array

See [`AdafruitGFX/CLAUDE.md`](../AdafruitGFX/CLAUDE.md) for `fontconvert` build and usage details.

## Investigations in progress

### Bug: second half of keyboard becomes unresponsive (slave stops sending key events)

**Symptom**: Intermittently, the right/slave half stops recognising keystrokes. Only keys on the master (USB) side still work. Reconnecting (replugging) or reflashing restores it. Happens "once in a while", not on every boot.

**Root cause identified (2026-04-29)**: Two separate EEPROM-write paths can block the slave's UART long enough to miss a split transaction response window, causing the master to declare the slave unresponsive. Both were introduced in commit `98ed47612d` ("eeprom refactoring — still needs testing", 2026-04-24). On the RP2040, EEPROM is wear-leveled flash; most writes are fast journal appends, but when the journal fills the firmware does a page consolidation (~50 ms blocking erase) — which is when the symptom occurs.

**Path 1 — blocked inside sync transaction handler (rare: only on default-layer change)**:
`eeconfig_update_default_layer()` was called directly inside `user_sync_layer_data_handler()`, a split UART transaction callback. Blocking there guaranteed a UART timeout whenever `def_layer` changed.

**Path 2 — blocked in housekeeping on the slave side (normal typing, brightness keys)**:
`mark_settings_dirty()` was called on the slave from `user_sync_poly_data_handler()` whenever the master synced a contrast or lang change (i.e. after any brightness key press). Five seconds later `brightness_save_if_pending()` fired on the slave in `housekeeping_task_user()`, writing EEPROM. The slave has no need to persist these values — the master is the authoritative owner and syncs them on every boot. This is the likely cause of occurrences during normal typing days with no layout switch.

**Fix applied (2026-04-29)**:
- `split_sync.c` `user_sync_layer_data_handler()`: replaced blocking `eeconfig_update_default_layer()` with `defer_default_layer_save()` — moves the flash write out of the UART transaction callback into housekeeping.
- `state.c` / `state.h`: added `defer_default_layer_save(layer_state_t)` and `default_layer_save_if_pending()`.
- `keymap.c` `housekeeping_task_user()`: added `default_layer_save_if_pending()` call on both sides.
- `brightness_save_if_pending()` was already deferred (5 s debounce, housekeeping) — no change needed there.

**How to confirm the fix worked**: reproduce by switching the default layer while typing on both halves. If the slave stays responsive, the sync-handler path is fixed.

**If the bug reappears after this fix**, the remaining risk is the RP2040 wear-leveling consolidation (~50 ms page erase) coinciding with a split UART transaction window, triggered by `brightness_save_if_pending()` firing in housekeeping 5 s after a brightness key press. This is a statistical coincidence, not a guaranteed block. Mitigations to try in order:

1. Also defer `save_user_latin()` in `user_sync_latin_ex_data_handler()` — still a direct EEPROM write inside a sync handler (triggered on language changes).
2. `eeprom_update_block()` in `dynamic_keymap_set_buffer_poly()` — also inside a sync handler, only during keymap remapping (VIA), lowest priority.
3. **Proper fix: offload EEPROM writes to core 1.** The keyboard already uses core 1 for RLE decompression via `multicore_exec.c` and the FIFO dispatch. Instead of calling `save_user_settings()` / `save_user_latin()` / `eeconfig_update_default_layer()` directly on core 0, post the write as a job to core 1 via the FIFO. Core 1 does the blocking flash operation while core 0 (QMK main loop, UART, USB) keeps running uninterrupted — eliminating the framing-corruption risk entirely. Main caveat: core 1 is currently single-purpose (RLE decompression), so the two job types must not collide; check that core 1 is idle before posting, or add a small job queue. EEPROM writes and RLE decompression are unlikely to overlap in practice since both are rare and burst-style.

### Bug: key displays turn on when keyboard is suspended/sleeping

**Symptom**: Per-keycap OLED displays briefly light up (or stay lit) when the keyboard should be in suspend/sleep state.

**Root cause identified (2026-04-29)**: `poly_suspend()` in `keymap.c` clears `STATUS_DISP_ON` and `DISP_IDLE` but did not clear `IDLE_TRANSITION`. If the keyboard was in the fade-out phase (IDLE_TRANSITION set in local_state but not yet propagated to global_state) when USB suspend was triggered, `sync_and_refresh_displays()` — called immediately after `poly_suspend()` from `suspend_power_down_kb()` — detects `back_from_idle_transition = true` (IDLE_TRANSITION in local but not global) and restores `contrast = ee.brightness` from EEPROM, overwriting the `DISP_OFF` value `poly_suspend()` had just set. This triggers `contrast_changed = true` → `set_displays(ee.brightness, false)` → `kdisp_enable(true)` on both master and slave — keycap displays turn on for one suspend cycle before the next iteration corrects it.

**Fix applied (2026-04-29)**: Added `IDLE_TRANSITION` to the flags cleared in `poly_suspend()`:
```c
local_state->flags &= ~((uint8_t)STATUS_DISP_ON) & ~((uint8_t)DISP_IDLE) & ~((uint8_t)IDLE_TRANSITION);
```

**If the bug reappears**: Check whether a split transport failure (the other bug above) is preventing the suspend state from reaching the slave — if the slave never receives `STATUS_DISP_ON=0` it will keep its displays on indefinitely. The two bugs can look identical from the outside.

**Relevant files**:
- `keyboards/handwired/polykybd/split72/keymaps/default/keymap.c` — `poly_suspend()`, `suspend_power_down_kb()`, `sync_and_refresh_displays()`
- `keyboards/handwired/polykybd/base/com.h` — flag bit definitions (`STATUS_DISP_ON`, `IDLE_TRANSITION`, `DISP_IDLE`)
