# Split synchronisation

Moved out of `CLAUDE.md` 2026-09-14. Verbatim.

## Split synchronisation
Seven custom QMK transaction IDs (`USER_SYNC_POLY_DATA`, `USER_SYNC_OVERLAY_DATA`, `USER_SYNC_COMPRESSED_DATA`, `USER_SYNC_ROI_DATA`, etc.) carry state and overlay data to the slave half over UART with CRC32 validation and up to 10 retries.

⚠️ **`RPC_M2S_BUFFER_SIZE` is a SILENT CEILING on every one of them, and it is a
CAPACITY, not a transfer size.** Two independent facts, both easy to get backwards:

- **Outgrowing it does not fail loudly.** `transaction_rpc_exec()`
  (`quantum/split_common/transactions.c`) checks `initiator2target_buffer_size >
  RPC_M2S_BUFFER_SIZE` and **returns false before sending anything** — while the bulk
  `send_to_bridge()` call sites discard the ack (the *discarding* sibling of the
  "never bool-test `send_to_bridge()`" rule). So a struct that grows past the cap
  produces a master that applies the change and a slave that never hears it, with
  **nothing in the log**. Caught in review, 2026-08-13: `latin_sync_t` went 63 → 90 B
  when the Intl remap gained the punctuation targets. `state.h` now carries a
  `static_assert(sizeof(latin_sync_t) <= RPC_M2S_BUFFER_SIZE)`; add one for any
  struct that can grow.
- **Raising it costs RAM and nothing else — measured, not reasoned.** The constant
  appears in exactly three places in QMK: the array declaration and the two rejection
  checks. Both ends size the real transfer from `rpc_info.payload.m2s_length`, i.e.
  the caller's own byte count. Verified by building the same tree at 96 and 128 and
  diffing the disassembly: `.text` identical in size, `.bss` +32 (exactly the delta),
  and of 954 differing lines **922 are `.word` RAM address literals**; the only real
  instruction changes are the `cmp` bounds check and two `adds` offsets into shmem.
  **No length, loop-count or transfer-size instruction changes anywhere in the
  image** — so unrelated traffic (matrix scan, pointing pull, overlay bursts) is
  byte-for-byte unaffected. Raised 72 → 96 in the same change; the monolith's `.heap`
  went 3852 → 3828.

⚠️ **The overlay path sits 3 bytes under the old cap — check it before adding a
field.** The 72 was sized for exactly these, all derived from `HID_REPORT_SIZE` 64:
`overlay_sync_t` 67 B, `overlay_map_sync_t` / `dynamic_keymap_sync_t` 68 B, and
**`compressed_overlay_sync_t` / `roi_overlay_sync_t` 69 B**. One more field, or an
`HID_REPORT_SIZE` bump, and an app switch would hit the silent rejection above and
present as missing keycap images. At 96 that path has 27 B of headroom.
